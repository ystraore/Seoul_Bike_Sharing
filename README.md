## Introduction
Bike sharing systems represent a modern evolution of traditional bike rentals, offering automated processes for membership registration, bike rental, and return. These systems facilitate the easy rental of bikes from one location and their return to another, contributing significantly to urban mobility, environmental sustainability, and public health. With over 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide, encompassing more than 500,000 bicycles, these systems have garnered considerable attention for their impact on traffic management and urban planning.

## Dataset Information
The data generated by bike-sharing systems are uniquely informative due to the detailed recording of travel duration, departure, and arrival positions. This granularity transforms bike-sharing systems into virtual sensor networks capable of sensing urban mobility patterns. Consequently, these systems provide invaluable data for urban studies, offering insights into city dynamics, event detection, and mobility patterns.

## Objectives
- To analyze bike-sharing system data to understand urban mobility patterns.
- To leverage the virtual sensor network created by bike-sharing systems for urban studies.
- To explore the impact of bike-sharing systems on traffic, environmental sustainability, and public health.

## Project Background
Bike-sharing systems have emerged as a key component of urban transportation networks, providing an eco-friendly alternative to motorized vehicles and contributing to the reduction of urban congestion. The comprehensive data collected by these systems offer a unique opportunity to study various aspects of urban life, from traffic patterns to the impact of public events on mobility.
